# LilbraryManagement
Summary

The objective of the project is to create a library management system that will allow the user to pick any book from the available book. The user can filer the type of book he wants by using various buttons present in the user interface. The user can also check his info as well.
The system will have the records of all books, users and their information once they have signed up and created an account with all the necessary data stored in the user database.
System has various data validations. User can’t issue more than one book at a time.
Librarians can easily look up any user and their records as well as having the ability to add, edit, delete or create any entries in the book and user database.
Introduction

The Library Management System project’s goal is to allow both users and librarians to easily be able to access all pertinent and essential data within the management system. The system will facilitate gathering user information and storing it for later analysis.
The system will be able to provide information the user by:
•	An account with all essential user information is created and stored
•	Listing all available books. 
•	Showing their own information
The system will allow the librarians to:
•	 View all users
•	Look up user information
•	Add, edit, delete, or create any records for the databases
The whole project is comprised of various components in order to make it all run smoothly. A web user interface, database editor, database query, report display. These various components will be implemented using a mixture of Java, HTML, CSS, JSP & Java Servlet. With all the components working together the rental system will make the user booking quicker and easier while making administrative work easier by offering better access to all pertinent information within the system
Project Components
Web User Interface: The graphical interface that is used in the web browser that allows both users and librarians to access and use the rental system.
•	Integral component to the whole project, it is the component the user used to interface and communicate with 
•	Important that the design is clear and simple to use and navigate
•	Two separate modes to access the library system; as a user or as an librarian
•	User mode: User login or create an account and are able to issue a book from the library.
•	Librarian mode: Only librarian may access this mode. It is used to look up users and books. Only librarians may edit records.

Database Editor: A Librarian only tool that is used to edit data within the databases that the car rental system uses to perform its job.
•	Executes and displays various queries that the librarian enters into the editor
•	The ability to add, delete, update records easily and safely

Database Query: Tool that is available only to the librarians to search the database for information about the rental bookings.
•	 Microsoft Access 
Report and Rental Display: Tool used to collect information across the various components of the entire rental system and show that information a logical and useful manner that can be easily read by librarian.
•	JSP
•	Servlet
•	Java
The reports will allow both the librarians to clearly view all pertinent data and facilitate any decision making or issues that they may face. 
•	Java, HTML, CSS, JSP & Java Servlet Base structures are all used in this project and are the fundamental building blocks on which this system is created on
o	Java is predominantly used in the backend and is what gives the system all it’s capabilities and functions
o	HTML is used for the web user interface and will be where the users interact with the system
o	CSS is used solely to enhance the user interface by make it more user-friendly and better designed
o	JSP and Java Servlets provide the connectivity needed to link the databases and the system’s web site and allow the whole system to function as intended.

# Usage
Change the connection strings in the files to match the location where you store the database.
